            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Abhiram Kalluri</strong>, an M.Tech. student in Chemical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India. My research, guided by Prof. K Ganapathy Ayappa and Prof. Ananth Govind Rajan, focuses on utilizing <strong>Molecular Dynamics</strong> to investigate evaporative and gas separations within <strong>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</strong>.</p>
            <p>Before joining IISc, I completed my undergraduate training in Chemical Engineering at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Andhra Pradesh, India. During my undergraduate studies, I explored diverse areas, including computational modeling of oxygen enrichment in Internal Combustion (IC) engines at JNCASR Bengaluru, an experience I gained through a summer research fellowship from the Indian Academy of Sciences. My Bachelor's thesis was a self-initiated project focused on modeling atmospheric flows using <strong>Shallow Water Equations</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Performance Evaluation of an Internal Combustion Engine by the enrichment of Oxygen in the inlet flow by Thermodynamics and CFD</h3>
        <p>This project involved a comprehensive study of oxygen enrichment in Internal Combustion (IC) engines, leveraging both theoretical thermodynamic principles and advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The research aimed to assess the impact of increased oxygen concentration in the inlet air on engine performance, efficiency, and emissions. Key aspects included modeling combustion processes, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics within the engine cylinder under various oxygen enrichment scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Modelling Atmospheric Flows with Shallow Water Equations</h3>
        <p>This self-inspired Bachelor's thesis explored the application of Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) for modeling atmospheric phenomena. The project involved developing computational models to simulate large-scale atmospheric flows, such as those related to weather systems and oceanic tides. It focused on understanding the fundamental principles behind fluid dynamics in shallow layers and their relevance to meteorological and oceanographic contexts.</p>
