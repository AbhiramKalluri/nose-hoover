            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As an M.Tech. student in chemical engineering, I employ Molecular Dynamics for the study of evaporative and gas separations through Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), under the combined guidance of Prof. K Ganapathy Ayappa and Prof. Ananth Govind Rajan, in the department of chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) Bengaluru, India. </p>
            <p>Prior to this, I received my undergraduate training in chemical engineering from the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Andhra Pradesh, India.</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate education, I explored varieties of areas in chemical engineering, involving computational modelling of oxygen enrichment in Internal Combustion (IC) engines at JNCASR Bengaluru under a summer research fellowship awarded by the Indian Academy of Sciences. My Bachelor's thesis was a self-inspired exploration of modelling atmospheric flows with Shallow Water Equations. </p>

                <h3>Performance Evaluation of an Internal Combustion Engine by the enrichment of Oxygen in the inlet flow by Thermodynamics and CFD</h3>
                <p>This project involved a comprehensive study of oxygen enrichment in Internal Combustion (IC) engines, leveraging both theoretical thermodynamic principles and advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The research aimed to assess the impact of increased oxygen concentration in the inlet air on engine performance, efficiency, and emissions. Key aspects included modeling combustion processes, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics within the engine cylinder under various oxygen enrichment scenarios.</p>
